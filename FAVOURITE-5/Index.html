    <h1> Hello!!!This Is Ausmeen,<br> Today I am going to tell about my hobby which is Playing Badminton </h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I like badminton most of all sports. I play badminton with my brother every day. I love playing this game in winter. Our teachers help in playing badminton in school. There are at least two people required for playing badminton. And at most four people can play this game. Our teachers also tell us about the advantages of playing this game. Our body stays healthy by playing this game. Not only badminton but any outdoor game is very good for our health. Badminton is very easy and it is also an outdoor sport. Due to this, badminton is my favorite sport.Badminton is a very old sport that started in British India. British India means when the British (British) ruled India. In this sport, two rackets and a shuttlecock are used. In many badminton courts, there is also a trap between the two players. Light and thin cotton are used in rackets. The shuttlecock is made of rubber and feathers. During the game, the players throw this shuttlecock with the help of a racket towards each other. According to whose side the shuttlecock falls, the front player gets a point. The maximum score in this game is 21. The player who scores more points within the given time will be the winner.</p>

    <h1> Saina Nehwal <br> <h2>Saina Nehwal is an Indian badminton player and India’s first shuttler to win a medal at the Olympics. She has been a world no. 1, and the only Indian woman to reach the landmark. Saina has over 23 international titles to her name. Off the 23, 10 are Superseries titles. Saina is an eminent athlete who has given immense contribution in making the sport of Badminton popular in the country.Saina was introduced to Badminton by her parents, Harvir Singh and Usha Rani. Both of them have been former champions in Haryana. In fact, the right-handed shuttler was born in Dhindar, in the Hisar district of Haryana. Female foeticide and discrimination were rampant in Haryana. Thus, being a girl child, Saina faced a lot of challenges and resistance from her family. Most notable among them was her grandmother, who refused to see her for a whole month
Today she is the face of the government’s Beti Bachao campaign.
        Saina used to frequent the local club where her mother would play. That proved to be the first exposure to badminton. As there was no professional facility of coaching for children, her father, Harvir had Saina enrolled for Karate. She fell in love with it and went on to ear a brown belt.

            <img class="image" src="A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam.jpg"><h1>A.P.J.Abdul Kalam <br><h2> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈæbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

            While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8] </h2></h1>
